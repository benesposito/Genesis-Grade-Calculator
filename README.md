# Genesis-Grade-Calculator
Python program I wrote to calculate my grade on Genesis (school grading website) because it is horribly inaccurate sometimes and to learn regex.

Just copy and paste all of your grades of a certain class into the text document, save, and run the script. It will output the grade. This can be useful for getting a more accurate value for your grade, seeing by how much a few points can change your grade, etc.

This was created firstly to learn how to use regex, and secondly because I found myself calculating all of my grades by hand with a calculator way too often.
